[**KFC, Coca-Cola, and KFC are being boycotted by Muslims from all over the world.In this presentaion we will explain you, How can boycotting these companies help save lives in Palestine? And what impact does this boycott have on Israel?**](https://github.com/aliiizaid123/boycott/new/main?readme=1)

In fact, the history of the Muslim boycott goes back many years, beginning with African leader **Nelson Mandela**. He led the world’s largest campaign against apartheid, freeing South Africa from American influence and racism. Mandela boldly declared, *“Palestine should be returned to Arabs; they are fighting for the right to self-determination.”* He stood alone against the superpower, America.

Inspired by him, a **World Conference Against Racism** was held in Africa to raise a voice against all oppression, including **Israel versus Palestine**. Yet only **Israel and America** boycotted it. The conference began in 2001 but ended abruptly when the **9/11 attacks** struck just two days later.

Years later, **Umar Barghouti** revived the struggle by uniting Muslims to **boycott Israel** through a movement called **BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions)**. Its target was Israeli companies—not American ones like Pepsi or KFC—so it faded from memory until **2023**, when Israel’s brutal war on Palestine reignited it.

But after six days of this attack, something strange happened: the famous American company KFC announced that they would provide free burgers to thousands of Israeli soldiers, and that every Israeli soldier would also receive a special discount on their burger.In the same way, major American companies announced their support for Israel, such as Burger King, Starbucks, and so on.
 People across faiths—**Muslims, Christians, atheists, and even Jews**—revived the **BDS boycott**,

 making it the **largest campaign in world history**. Yet it remains **controversial**, dividing Muslims between those who see it as symbolic and those who view it as a moral duty.

### **Debate Summary: Impact of the Boycott Campaign**

[**Those who oppose the boycott argue that for the past two years, this campaign has been ongoing and Israel has not suffered any losses. They call it pointless and ineffective, claiming it changes nothing on the ground and only gives people a false sense of activism.**](https://github.com/aliiizaid123/boycott/new/main?readme=1)

**In response, boycott advocates firmly reject this notion, stating that the campaign has caused enormous damage to Israel. They point out that Israel has spent millions trying to stop this movement because it knows that if the Muslim-led boycott ends, it would gain billions. Since the start of this conflict, major global companies have withdrawn from Israel — the biggest example being Intel, which ended a $25 billion deal, marking the largest deal cancellation in Israel’s history. The pressure has been so immense that nearly six thousand Israeli companies have shut down, and the total losses have reached around $300 billion, proving that the boycott is working and hitting where it hurts the most.**
**When we consider all the total losses of this war, it amounts to about $300 billion, and so far, Israel has killed 66,000 Palestinians, meaning that for every Palestinian life lost, Israel has incurred a loss of $5 million.

[**Wait, wait… But if Israel is harming Palestinians, then people want to boycott Israel. American companies like Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and KFC—these are all American companies, so what connection do they have with Israel?**](https://github.com/aliiizaid123/boycott/new/main?readme=1)

**They do have a connection.** Because of these companies’ investments, Israel has a strong presence globally. Every year, these American corporations invest billions of dollars in Israel, directly supporting its government, military, and economy. However, these same companies operate in 57 Islamic countries, where nearly 2 billion Muslims consume their products daily. If all Muslims unite and tell these corporations to choose between 2 billion Muslim customers or 10 million Israelis, they’ll be forced to pull their investments out of Israel — and this shift has already begun.

[**These American companies — Pepsi, Coca-Cola, KFC, McDonald’s — have given jobs to millions, and boycotting them will make many poor people jobless. It’s cruel but true.**](https://github.com/aliiizaid123/boycott/new/main?readme=1)

**True — but every great nation is built through sacrifice. When Japan crushed China in World War II, China rose by producing its own goods, and “Made in China” became a global mark of power. Likewise, the boycott may hurt now, but it’s birthing new strength: Pakistan’s “Gola Nest,” Malaysia’s “ZUS Coffee,” Egypt’s “Bazooka Chicken,” Turkey’s “CTR Chicken,” and Indonesia’s “CFC.” For every job lost to Pepsi and KFC, a new one rises under our own flag.**

[**There’s benefit in the boycott, sure — but why stop at Pepsi, KFC, and McDonald’s? Why not boycott *every* American brand — Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, even YouTube where people talk about boycotts while using U.S. platforms? Isn’t that hypocrisy?**](https://github.com/aliiizaid123/boycott/new/main?readme=1)

**That’s not hypocrisy — it’s strategy. No boycott in history has ever meant rejecting everything from the enemy. Gandhi boycotted British goods but used their railways and medicine. Einstein renounced Hitler but not German technology. The goal isn’t blind rejection — it’s precision. A boycott is a weapon, and victory comes not from throwing every stone, but from striking where it hurts the most.**

[**I feel that the example of this boycott is such that if a person puts a Gun in my head to kill me, and I pick up a stone to fight him.**](https://github.com/aliiizaid123/boycott/new/main?readme=1)

** This is absolutely true. But my point is that if a person puts a glass in my head to kill me, and I pick up a stone to fight him.” **
